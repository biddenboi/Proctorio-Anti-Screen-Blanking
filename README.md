#### Removing Proctorio Screen Blurring
Proctorio has added a feature where you screen now blurs whenever you press control. This makes it impossible to copy and paste or otherwise view the webpage. This would be fine, however this setting is applied equally regardless of you being on the homepage or within an test. In order to prevent this annoyance, this extension simply removes it altogether.

#### Usage
1. run `git clone git@github.com:biddenboi/Proctorio-Anti-Screen-Blanking.git` or download this extension from the upper right.
2. Unpack this extension and head over to your extensions page
3. Enable developer mode if you have not done so, then click `load unpacked` and head over to the location of this file.
